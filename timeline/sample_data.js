From his travels in East Asia, in 1858 Alfred Russel Wallace reported similar conclusions to those Charles Darwin had begun to formulate since his voyage to South America on the Beagle: that species arise as a result of natural selection. Darwin's friends persuaded him to publish his work. In 'On the Origin of Species', Darwin argued that those individuals that are best adapted to survive in their environments are most likely to breed successfully, and so pass on their beneficial traits to future generations. Over the eons of geological time this could lead to new species.\n<p>\n&nbsp; \n</p>",

He encouraged a friar, Gregor Mendel, to explore questions of heredity by breeding pea plants. Mendel crossed varieties with different characteristics, such as smooth or wrinkled seed cases, and discovered that in most cases characteristics did not blend, but continued to appear in subsequent generations in predictable ratios. He found that 'dominant' characteristics would appear even if inherited from only one parent, while offspring showed 'recessive' characteristics only if they inherited them from both parents. He published his work in the journal of his local natural history society.",

He looked for evidence for this idea by analysing the pedigrees of distinguished judges, poets, statesmen, scientists and sportsmen. In 'Hereditary Genius: An Inquiry into its Causes and Consequences', he applied statistical ideas such as error frequencies to show that human abilities were inherited. Concluding that such abilities might be improved by selective breeding, he later coined the term 'eugenics' to denote this practice.",

Flemming published his findings in 1882 in 'Zell-substanz, Kern und Zelltheilung' ('Cytoplasm, Nucleus and Cell Division'). He coined the term 'chromatin' ('stainable material'), which is still in use today. The word 'chromosome' (meaning 'coloured body') was not introduced until 1888, when German anatomist Wilhelm Waldeyer used it to describe the thread-like bodies in the nucleus. <br />",

It was not until 16 years after his death in 1884 that his work was more widely acknowledged, when three competing European botanists published their work and recognised Mendel's priority. Hugo de Vries in Holland, Carl Correns in Germany and Erich Tschermak von Seysenegg in Austria had made similar observations on the segregation and recombination of observable characters, although they reached stronger conclusions about the existence of physical hereditary units that explained those characters. By 1902, the English geneticist William Bateson had translated Mendel's articles into English and argued strongly in their favour.<br />",

A further blood type, O, was accepted by A or B types. The AB type, discovered later by two of his colleagues, contained both antigens and accepted any other type.

Arthur Mourant joined the staff of the North East London Blood supply depot in 1944, as a newly qualified doctor. Testing this prediction, he discovered antibodies to Rhesus e. The discovery helped to confirm Race and Fisher's theory and the discovery of the first gene complex in humans. It also refined the process of blood matching and provided further insight into haemolytic disease of the newborn.<br />",

Later work showed that Down's syndrome is caused by an extra copy of chromosome 21. The same year, others identified chromosomal abnormalities in Turner syndrome (females who lack all or part of an X chromosome) and Klinefelter syndrome (males who have at least one extra X chromosome).<br />",

The race was won by Lap-Chee Tsui at the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto and Francis Collins at the University of Michigan, who used genetic markers to home in on a region of chromosome 7. They discovered that most cystic fibrosis patients were missing a set of three nucleotides on both of their chromosomes. The mutation was in a gene that codes for a protein called cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator, or CFTR, which regulates the flow of chloride ions across membranes in the lungs and other tissues. The discovery opened the way to further study of the protein and its function but did not instantly lead to new therapies.<br />",
