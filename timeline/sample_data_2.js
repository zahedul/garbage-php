From his travels in East Asia, in 1858 Alfred Russel Wallace reported similar conclusions to those Charles Darwin had begun to formulate since his voyage to South America on the Beagle: that species arise as a result of natural selection. Darwin's friends persuaded him to publish his work. In 'On the Origin of Species', Darwin argued that those individuals that are best adapted to survive in their environments are most likely to breed successfully, and so pass on their beneficial traits to future generations. Over the eons of geological time this could lead to new species. \n</p>\n<p><a class=\"action\" title=\"On the origin of species 1859\" href=\"http://wellcomelibrary.org/player/b1802922x#0/5/-0.6813,0,2.3626,1.457\" target=\"_blank\">Read&nbsp;'On&nbsp;the Origin of Species'&nbsp;&nbsp;</a>\n</p>\n",

The Canadian neuroscientist Murray Barr discovered dark-staining bodies in the nuclei of the neurons of female cats. He and his colleague E G Bertram found that they were made of chromosomal material. He confirmed that other female mammals also have these structures, which were later called 'sex chromatin' or 'Barr bodies'. This made it possible to diagnose individuals who had conditions attributed to extra or missing copies of the X chromosome.<br />",

His colleague John Kendrew used this method, together with some of the first crystallographic computer programs, to solve the structure of the myoglobin protein at low resolution. They were surprised to find that the molecule was complex and irregular. In 1959 Perutz published a similar low-resolution structure for haemoglobin, showing that each of its four subunits bore a close resemblance to myoglobin, even though Kendrew's molecule had come from whale meat and Perutz's from horse blood. The discoveries provided evidence that Darwin's theory of evolution holds true at the level of individual molecules. Perutz and Kendrew were awarded the 1962 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. \n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Image courtesy of the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology </em>\n</p>",

This way they could chart relationships between the different species and estimated that modern humans diverged genetically from Denisovans and Neanderthals around 800,000 years ago, while this particular Denisovan girl lived about 80,000 years ago.
